About
----

IscaRegimes is a versatile toolkit designed to extract dynamical regimes from **Isca** (https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-843-2018) simulations; however, it can also be applied to reanalysis and CMIP datasets. 

This toolkit is primarily based on the **NEMI** algorithm developed by Maike Sonnewald (https://github.com/CompClimate/NEMI/), a flexible unsupervised learning framework designed to find dominant balances in geospatial data. Leveraging this framework, the toolkit introduces a novel entropy-based approach for uncertainty quantification.

It also utilizes the dominant balance identification code from Bryan Kaiser (https://github.com/bekaiser/dominant_balance), which is an objective method for labeling dynamical regimes.
